# ROHONGODB

ROHONGODB is a web-scale blazing fast key-value store for cool people like Rohan. It has a bunch of awesome cool features for cool developers.

ROHONGODB stores all data in a single JSON file. Of course, since this is WEB-SCALE, the JSON file is gzipped. The entire database is stored on every write, because ROHONGODB is web-scale, and web-scale means no data loss except when it's ok. 

ROHONGODB features an HTTP API, because HTTP is great and cool and everybody loves it. It's easy and simple to use.

ROHONGODB has no auth, because auth isn't web-scale. Without auth, you don't need to enforce password restrictions. Just trust that people will do the right thing.

In ROHONGODB, all data is stored as a string. Types are evil.

```
To get a value:
```

```
This will return the following JSON data:

```

Any error will return 'error'.
